# Island Trader Game

## Background

---

This game was a project I ever wrote using Java (Beginning of 2021). One day I would love to come back to this project and try rewrite it. 
Note that that application was originally created in Eclipse using build in methods for compiling and running the 
application. I added a springboot startup just so that I could run the application a few years later. 

### Key Learnings 

- A great introduction to Java and OOP principles,
- My first major GUI application,
- Frustrations with classpath issues solidified my understanding of using resources.


### Reflection

I think I am learning just as much from this project 2 years later (May 2023). This project gives me a real appreciation
for how far I've come in my software engineering journey. I think it's also humbling because I remember being so proud 
of this project and thinking it was fantastic. It makes me wonder if the work I produce now will look awful in a couple
more years time.

## Running the applciation. 


--- 

Since this application has been migrated to a gradle using springboot for quick start the application can be run using
the command:

```shell
./gradlew bootRun
```
